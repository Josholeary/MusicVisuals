## Intro
Welcome to the markdown for my OOP assignment, "Something beautiful to enjoy while listening to music.".
I will be writing on the following topics: 
-	Description of the assignment
-	Instructions on how to use the program
-	How it works
-	What I am most proud of in the assignment

# Description of the assignment
My assignment is a music visualizer that uses several different audio reactive visuals that respond to the amplitude of a song, these allow someone to sit back and really connect with the music as they watch the different visuals artistically portray the song they are listening to. It allows for the user to fully control what visuals they want to watch and to pause, play and restart the song at any point.

# Instructions
*Music controls*
- Q - Play
- W - Pause
- E - Restart
*Visual controls*
- 1 - Planets
- 2 - Disco Spheres
- 3 - Spinner
- 4 - Rainbow speaker
- 9 - Menu
- 0 - Toggle border effect

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
